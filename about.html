          <h2>About Us</h2>

          <p><a href="index.html">Return to Home</a></p>

          <p><strong>Our motto: No Sign Left Behind.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Our mission: For people to point and laugh at you, while sporting Durtbagz gear.</strong></p>

          <p>It all started when I saw the sign. Literally.</p>

          <p>On a hike in Tucson, I saw the most ridiculous street sign. It showed a biker that had taken his bike over the edge of a bridge and was just falling onto the rocks below. And it didn’t stop there. The biker was drilling his head on the rocks, while his bike had already hit and had a mangled front tire. Brilliant. </p>

          <p>At that moment, Durtbagz was born. </p>

          <p>How do we come up with these funny street signs? It’s a top secret equation that we keep locked in the vault, showing new employees only after we run them through a series of rigorous tests involving sleep deprivation and a strict diet of Diet Tab and Good and Plenty’s. I can’t tell you what the formula is for obvious reasons, but I will tell you it sounds like </p>

          <h2>“1 part beer + 2 parts time on our hands = Durtbagz”.</h2>

          <p>Actually, we take a regular street sign or an everyday situation, and “add” some beer to it. In other words, what would happen to this scenario if there were beer involved, and voila, Durtbagz sign. </p>

          <p>We started with bags and not just any bags, but super durable, functional, water-resistant bags that girls and guys alike use to haul around their gear. We branched out and added killer shirts to our line, due to the demands of our loyal Durtbagz. Since our bags are so high quality, we didn’t have any choice but to use Alternative Apparel for our shirts. Super soft, pre-shrunk, and stretchy, these shirts are uber comfortable and built to last that.</p>

          <p>Why do we do this? Because we take comedy seriously. Someone has to make the world a funnier place and those someones are Durtbagz. </p>

          <p>We like to show our appreciation by occasionally giving out free Durtbagz gear to our friends, so find us on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr for a chance at receiving random gifts from time to time. (can we link to our other places here?)</p>

          <p>Oh, and if you have a sign idea, contact us. We’ll put it through the secret equation and see if it makes the cut.</p>
